            <div align="center">Welcome to Lil' Chompy's Homepage, The
              Order of the Toothy Grin!<br>
              <br>
              As an alligators are so perfect we decided to skip
              evolution I decided to build the page dedicated to my
              order at the peak of web design. Nested Tables, gif,
              chonky borders, that's the good stuff. You kids can keep
              your rust and your golang. HTML4SWAMPLYFE.<br>
              <br>
              The Order of the Toothy Grin is the finest group of people
              helping Lil' Chompy support his lavish lifestyle of
              international intrigue and that requires bail money.
              What's left helps support the organization that the
              Chompster uses for insurance benefits. Your pal Chompy has
              grown to love all you infosec folks especially after you
              helped me out with that think in SÃ£o Paulo. Who knew the
              warrant was still good after 20 years, thankfully the law
              down there was running Windows XP. Ya'll really got me out
              of a bind. I thought I was boots and belt for sure this
              time. <br>
              <br>
              Below is a list of the members of The Order of the Toothy
              Grin. Lil' Chompy certifies they have given their time and
              treasure in the aid of BSides Orlando. Lil' Chompy
              certification is a certification you can trust! If they
              ever need help they can make a sound like a bunch laser
              sound effects from a 1980's arcade game. If I am not
              sunning myself on a log or death rolling an enemy I'll
              come runnin'. <br>
